# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves implementing an icon API integration system that allows the application to dynamically load and display icons from various sources. The system should provide a centralized way to manage icon resources, support multiple icon providers, and ensure efficient loading and caching of icon assets.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate with icon APIs, so that I can dynamically load icons without bundling them in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load icon API configuration settings
2. WHEN an icon is requested THEN the system SHALL fetch it from the configured API endpoint
3. IF an API request fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback icon handling
4. WHEN an icon is successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL cache it for future use

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure multiple icon API sources, so that I can have redundancy and access to different icon libraries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL support multiple API endpoint definitions
2. WHEN a primary API fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to load from secondary sources
3. IF all configured APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL use local fallback icons
4. WHEN API priorities are set THEN the system SHALL respect the defined order

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want icons to load quickly and efficiently, so that the interface remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an icon is requested for the first time THEN the system SHALL cache it locally
2. WHEN a cached icon is requested THEN the system SHALL serve it without API calls
3. WHEN the cache reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL implement LRU eviction policy
4. WHEN icons are preloaded THEN the system SHALL batch requests to optimize performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to specify icon parameters (size, color, format), so that I can customize icons for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting an icon THEN the system SHALL accept size parameters
2. WHEN requesting an icon THEN the system SHALL accept color/theme parameters
3. WHEN requesting an icon THEN the system SHALL accept format specifications (SVG, PNG, etc.)
4. IF invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error handling and logging for icon API operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN fallback icons are used THEN the system SHALL log the fallback event
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff
4. IF network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL queue requests for retry
